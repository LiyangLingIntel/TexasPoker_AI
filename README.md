# Texas_AI
A game in trend, this is a game ai implemented by myself.

To get the main idea and work in a proper way, I refer to http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/04/programming-poker-ai/
which gives thoughts in __processing cards__,__calculating hand values__, __make fold/call/raise decisions__ and __some protecting mechanisms__. Based on them, I make some extensions and supplements according to rules in trend official website.
